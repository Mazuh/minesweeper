# Minesweeper

Find mines in your dark terminal. Powered by emojis. ðŸ˜‰

## Setting up

Having `g++` with C++ 17 support, just run this inside the cloned repository:

```sh
make
```

That's it. Compiled using my Pop!_OS. I have no idea of how to run it in other environments.

## Disclaimer

I don't even really know C++, this was created cause I was bored during COVID-19 quarantine.
